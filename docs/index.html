<h1 id="peralta-distributed-rlvf-over-wifi">Peralta üåêü§ñüõú<span class="subtitle">Distributed RLVF Over Wifi</span><a class="headerlink" href="#peralta-distributed-rlvf-over-wifi" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h1>
<p>This project is the simplest possible <a href="https://github.com/kahnvex/peralta">implementation</a>
of distributed RL with verifiable reward (RLVF) that I am capable of writing. What is written here is
part design document, part personal manifesto, and part pet project.</p>
<p>This blog post demonstrates distributed training environments where:</p>
<ol>
<li>The trainer‚Äìgenerator data link is constrained by traversing a Wi-Fi 6E link</li>
<li>The trainer‚Äìgenerator data link is constrained by traversing the open internet (over VPN)</li>
</ol>
<p>Without giving too much away, my primary conclusion from this exercise is that
larger-scale distributed RL training runs are not only possible, but much closer
in reach than I had initially suspected.</p>
<p>You might ask: <em>Why do this? What's the point?</em></p>
<p>I've wanted to do this for a long time. Not this exact thing‚ÄîRLVF hasn't been
around that long‚Äîbut I've long wanted to take a system I've implemented or seen
implemented in large tech companies and boil it down to the most fundamental
parts. How compact can we make a system that's usually 10k lines of code in a
big tech org? What's the smallest amount of compute required to implement a
working distributed RL system? <strong>In this case it only took ~500 lines of code, a
good network, $500 in small form factor computers, and a MacBook.</strong></p>
<p>Granted, this is missing many necessary features, but the fundamentals are
there. This can be scaled out bit by bit. If you did scale it out, you'd no
doubt end up replacing nearly every line of code in this program, but that's not
the point. The point is to get the correct starting place from which you can
develop something more general and scalable.</p>
<p>I have an opportunity to work on this project because I arranged five weeks after leaving Meta.
I rejoin Google DeepMind in October, and until then, I am free to play with whatever
technologies and techniques I want to learn about.</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#objective" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The goal is to learn a simple task in the following setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Small model for fast iteration</li>
<li>Modest hardware to make this approachable and inexpensive</li>
<li>Distributed heterogeneous compute (CUDA, CPU, MPS)</li>
<li>Minimal code, zero configuration, and minimal generalization for maximum simplicity</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#constraints" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>All models trained are ‚â§1B parameters (Gemma/Qwen). These
models learn to translate a natural language math problem into a Python-esque
syntax that the system can execute (a very simple calculator tool).</p>
<h3 id="hardware-constraints">Hardware Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-constraints" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>My setup uses three primary machines and a few peripheral ones. Anything I was
incapable of doing with these machines, I considered out of scope.</p>
<ol>
<li>üíª An M2 MacBook Air, by far the most expensive and capable machine (primary)</li>
<li>üü© An 8GB Jetson Orin Nano Super, the only CUDA-enabled machine (primary)</li>
<li>üñ•Ô∏è An old ThinkStation small form factor PC (primary)</li>
<li>üåê Unifi Network Gateway and Switch (networking equipment, peripheral)</li>
<li>‚õÅ Network Attached Storage machine for checkpointing and other necessities (peripheral)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="opinions-on-software-design">Opinions on Software Design<a class="headerlink" href="#opinions-on-software-design" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I decided early on not to generalize any part of the
program. The goal isn't reusable abstractions, but instead learning useful
concepts I can apply to more complex tasks later. Generalizing before you fully
understand something is a fundamental mistake‚Äîand probably the most common
mistake among engineers rewarded for impact. You almost always over-generalize
or generalize the wrong parts, adding unneeded complexity future engineers must
wade through.</p>
<p>The sad reality is most RL training systems are over-engineered inheritance hell
on steroids, built in a race for glory, funding, or promotion. To be clear, I'm
not faulting engineers‚Äîthey're following the industry's incentive structure.
Also, most software starts off simple and grows more complex over time as
feature creep and reprioritization take hold.</p>
<p>During my five weeks working alone, I could sidestep all of this. I could
explore solutions without distorted incentives nudging my decision-making.</p>
<p>This keep-it-simple approach led me to an ironic insight: software complexity is
very difficult to measure empirically, and I suspect for this reason our
language models, trained with RLVF, aren't predisposed to creating the simplest
solution‚Äîjust a valid one. Like any good engineer, I've been making copious use
of LLMs for programming. What I found was that keeping programs simple was
actually harder when using coding models. Delegating to them often produced
solutions more complex than needed, or suboptimal in hindsight once additional
functionality was required. I did get plenty of value from LLMs, but in certain
cases where critical design decisions were involved, delegation led to worse
outcomes.</p>
<p>This reasoning led me to three rules I followed like gospel.</p>
<h4 id="1-design-rule-one-one-file">1Ô∏è‚É£üìÑ Design Rule One: One File<a class="headerlink" href="#1-design-rule-one-one-file" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>All code must live in a single file. This makes
iterating much faster. I can find, edit, delete, and refactor code more easily.
I use Cursor often, but when I need to use other chatbots, having everything in
a single file makes copy‚Äìpaste trivial.</p>
<h4 id="design-rule-two-zero-configuration">üö´‚öôÔ∏è Design Rule Two: Zero Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#design-rule-two-zero-configuration" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>The programs I wrote take no CLI flags, read no external configuration files,
and require no setup. Any hyperparameters are defined as global constants at the
top of the file. Need to change the batch size? Change one line.</p>
<p>This prevents indirection from creeping in. You never have to ask yourself
‚Äúshould this be configured or hard coded?‚Äù It's always hard coded. Need to
change the loss function? In a config-driven system, you'd define it, add a flag,
and wire it up. In a zero-config system, it's just a code edit‚Äîno extra
complexity.</p>
<h4 id="design-rule-three-no-generics">üö´üß© Design Rule Three: No Generics<a class="headerlink" href="#design-rule-three-no-generics" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>No <code>Generic[T]</code>, no abstract over-generalization. Some functions may <em>look</em>
generic, but as soon as something needs changing, they break. This is intentional: I
care about learning, not generality.</p>
<h3 id="standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">Standing on the Shoulders of Giants<a class="headerlink" href="#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>One design preference I have is to avoid reinventing the wheel. I have limited
time and I don't want to spend it debugging why an RPC is failing. This means
using tooling such as Ray Core to handle inter-machine communication, the
Transformers library for generation and training, and PyTorch for everything
in between.</p>
<p>I considered making this a rule, but breaking it isn't an option, it's closer to
a law. Without these technologies, this project would have been impossible.
Thank you to the maintainers of these amazing systems. More on this later.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#the-solution" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h2>
<h3 id="producerconsumer">Producer‚ÄìConsumer<a class="headerlink" href="#producerconsumer" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I model the sampling-to-training data flow as a producer‚Äìconsumer problem. There
is a single class called <code>Batcher</code> that handles most of this logic. The batcher
reads data, creates generations, and enqueues those generations for
the trainer.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Batcher</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="sd">        Batches are yielded until the queue is empty, at which point the iterator blocks until there is</span>
<span class="sd">        another batch to yield.</span>
<span class="sd">        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">load_checkpoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="sd">        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>produce</code> function starts worker threads that send RPCs with prompts to the
generator. Once generations are returned, the function enqueues them.
If the queue reaches its maximum size, it applies backpressure by blocking
producer threads from enqueueing additional generations.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-and-physical-topology">Hardware and Physical Topology<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-and-physical-topology" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I tried various topologies, including running the entire algorithm on a single
host‚Äîthe M2 Air‚Äîwhich worked but was terribly slow and would intermittently
lock up my machine.</p>
<p>Soon after, I added a second host, the SFF ThinkStation (a CPU machine), and used
it as the only generator. This worked very well: it improved step time
significantly and allowed me to do other work on my laptop as training
progressed.</p>
<p>Eventually, I added the Jetson device as a second sampler. This was definitely
unnecessary, as it resulted in underutilization of the samplers. Still, it was
fun to get this setup working consistently. There are a few quirks, like
getting the correct <code>torch</code> installed on the right machines. I used architecture
selectors in <code>pyproject.toml</code> purely for convenience, though this approach is
not ideal and shouldn't generally be recommended. I only wanted one
<code>pyproject.toml</code> that worked on all machines, and I needed a way to single out
the Jetson to install a CUDA-specific <code>torch</code> build.</p>
<p>You'll notice the trainers and generators are treated as "pets"‚Äîeach machine is
selected in a hard-coded manner. Again, simplicity over generality. Because I'm
using heterogeneous compute and didn't want to develop generic hardware
selection logic, I just pinned Ray actors to specific machines.</p>
<p>These three machines are networked over my LAN in the following topology:</p>
<p><img alt="Network topology diagram" src="assets/network_topo.png" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; display: block" /></p>
<p class="comment">
This diagram shows the physical network layout. The hostnames in the diagram
are only configured on my LAN.
</p>

<p>I said the goal of this project was to keep it simple‚ÄîI mostly meant the code,
not the hardware. Here's a look at my admittedly over-engineered network rack:</p>
<p><img alt="Network and compute rack" src="assets/rack.jpg" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; display: block" /></p>
<p class="comment">
From top to bottom: Network attached storage (UNAS Pro), camera and access
point patch panel, PoE switch (USW Pro Max 24), device and accessory patch
panel, Unifi gateway (UDM Pro Max), Lenovo ThinkCentre SFF PC (left), and Jetson
Orin Nano Super (right).
</p>

<p>This obviously looks expensive, but the reality is, if you can figure out
network storage and have a decent everyday machine, the remaining compute can
be purchased for around $500. The Jetson Orin Nano Super retails for $249
(before shipping or tax), and a cheap 10-year-old ThinkCentre PC is probably
around $200. I had this one in a box full of USB cables from a decade-old
project that never came to be.</p>
<p>You don't need all this fancy network and compute infrastructure to do
something similar. However, it does help by providing functionality such as local
DNS, simple VPN setup, solid networking, reliable storage, and so on. It's also
fun to set up and learn about this equipment.</p>
<p>I also performed a training run while I was in Tahoe with the M2 Air as the
trainer. In this setup, the laptop was VPN'd into my home network, using
both rack machines as generators. As you can imagine, this was much, much slower
than the colocated setup since the trainer had to send updated checkpoints to the
generators over the open internet.</p>

After each step, the weights must traverse the open internet so the generators
can get an update.

</code></pre></div>

<p>The datasets have two columns: <code>python_expression</code> and <code>natural_language</code>. The <code>python_expression</code> column
contains an executable math expression, and <code>natural_language</code> contains the unstructured natural language
translation of that expression.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the model's job is to convert the natural language into an expression that can be
evaluated to the correct answer. The <code>python_expression</code> column is used to compute the ground truth.</p>
<p>The three datasets are:</p>
<table>

<p>This data is mostly generated by other language models and may contain some errors.</p>
<h3 id="reward">Reward<a class="headerlink" href="#reward" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Reward is computed by the following function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">reward_fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">generation</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">:</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>eval_math</code> function is equivalent to Python's <code>eval</code>, but only for
operations such as <code>+, -, *, /, ...</code>.</p>
<h3 id="loss">Loss<a class="headerlink" href="#loss" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>I didn't spend much time trying different loss functions or tuning the ones I
did implement. I started with the simplest possible option: REINFORCE policy gradient.
From there I implemented GRPO, but found it difficult to beat REINFORCE on this
simple task.</p>
<p>None of these loss functions use a KL penalty. My intuition is that the KL term
serves no purpose here, since the objective is to overfit to an extremely narrow task. There's
no reason to retain natural language generation capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="reinforce">REINFORCE<a class="headerlink" href="#reinforce" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>The <code>math_reinforce.py</code> experiment uses a vanilla REINFORCE policy gradient,
where advantage is computed over <span class="arithmatex">\(K\)</span> generations per prompt as:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
A_i = R_i - \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^K R_j
\]</div>
<p>The loss is the negative reward-weighted token log-likelihood over the generated
tokens only:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathcal{L}_{REINFORCE}(\theta) = - \sum_t A_t \,\text{log} \pi_{\theta}(a_t | s_t)
\]</div>
<p>There is no KL penalty, no clipping, and no value function.</p>
<h4 id="grpo">GRPO<a class="headerlink" href="#grpo" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p><strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong> keeps PPO-style stability but
replaces the baseline with a <em>group</em> baseline computed over the <span class="arithmatex">\(K\)</span> samples
drawn for the <strong>same prompt</strong>. For each prompt, draw <span class="arithmatex">\(K =
\texttt{_GENERATIONS_PER_PROMPT}\)</span> completions, score them with a verifiable
reward <span class="arithmatex">\(R_i \in \{0,1\}\)</span>, and form a <strong>group-normalized advantage</strong> that is
then broadcast to all generated tokens in that sequence:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
A_i \;=\; \frac{R_i - \mu_{\mathcal{G}}}{\sigma_{\mathcal{G}} + \epsilon}, \qquad
\mu_{\mathcal{G}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^{K} R_j, \quad
\sigma_{\mathcal{G}}^2 = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{j=1}^{K}(R_j-\mu_{\mathcal{G}})^2.
\]</div>
<p>If all rewards in the group are identical (<span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma_{\mathcal{G}} = 0\)</span>), skip
the update (there's no learning signal) ‚Äî that guard exists in the producer.</p>
<p>We teacher-force over the full sequence (prompt + generated) but <strong>mask out
prompt tokens</strong> so the loss only touches generated tokens. Let</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\ell_t = \log \pi_\theta(a_t \mid s_t), \quad 
\ell^{\text{old}}_t = \log \pi_{\text{old}}(a_t \mid s_t), \quad
r_t = \exp(\ell_t - \ell^{\text{old}}_t).
\]</div>
<p>Then the <strong>clipped GRPO objective</strong> per token is the usual PPO surrogate with a
<em>sequence-level</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(A_i\)</span> broadcast to all its generated tokens:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GRPO}}(\theta) \;=\; 
- \,\mathbb{E}_{t \in \text{gen}}\Big[
\min\big(r_t A_i,\; \mathrm{clip}(r_t, 1-\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon)\,A_i\big)
\Big].
\]</div>
<h2 id="results">Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Though not my primary motivation, I did try to improve performance with various
training algorithms and some tuning.</p>

<p>Qwen3 0.6B with REINFORCE achieved 100% reward on the training set before reaching
step 16. I terminated it after a few hours to confirm it had aced the training set.</p>
<p>I was only able to complete a single Tahoe training run before the local cable
ISP throttled my uplink, which caused all subsequent runs to fail. I tried to
work around this by moving the trainer to one of the rack machines and moving a
sampler to Tahoe, but the ISP still throttled traffic over my VPN.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure, but I suspect this is a consequence of net neutrality being
overturned. The ISP's automated systems likely detected high uplink traffic to a
VPN server with an AT&amp;T IP in Oakland and began blocking that traffic.</p>

<p>I don't have many scientific conclusions. The goal wasn't to push the boundary
on research ‚Äî I knew that would be nearly impossible with my modest budget. I will
say I'm very impressed with the smaller models I experimented with. Not
mentioned here is Gemma 3 270m, which I played with for a while but didn't have
time to fully adapt my program to.</p>
<p>I also didn't have time to get GRPO fully working. Although I got a few decent runs
out of it, I wish I'd had more time to beat REINFORCE or determine exactly why it
underperforms.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-heterogeneous-training-runs-are-possible">Distributed Heterogeneous Training Runs are Possible<a class="headerlink" href="#distributed-heterogeneous-training-runs-are-possible" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>My main conclusion is that, in principle, running a large distributed
heterogeneous cluster to train an 8B+ model is possible. The automation,
coordination, and tuning would be difficult, but I'm convinced a group
of cooperating individuals, each with modest compute (e.g., 5090-class GPUs), could effectively
train a fully open-source model (weights, code, data, etc.).</p>
<h4 id="globally-distributed-rl">Globally Distributed RL<a class="headerlink" href="#globally-distributed-rl" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h4>
<p>Scaling this up globally to a heterogeneous pool of compute should be possible in
the following configuration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Centralized trainer with very high uplink bandwidth</li>
<li>Distributed generation with sufficient downlink bandwidth (500 Mbps might suffice for an 8B model)</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows the trainer to upload updated weights to hundreds or even thousands
of generators at predefined intervals.</p>
<p>Another option is to upload checkpoints from the trainer to a cloud provider's storage
service such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS). The downside is paying the
cloud provider for the egress traffic, which will not be insignificant for longer
training runs on medium sized models (20B+).</p>
<h3 id="balance-is-harder-than-you-think">Balance is Harder than You Think<a class="headerlink" href="#balance-is-harder-than-you-think" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Another difficult task was ensuring each machine was doing roughly the right
<em>amount</em> of work. If the trainer runs too fast, it sits idle waiting for
generations. If the trainer lags, the generators sit idle waiting for it to
consume training examples.</p>
<p>Good utilization comes from keeping generation and training in balance. That
doesn't mean perfect symmetry‚Äînetwork hiccups, GPU variability, and other
bottlenecks will always exist‚Äîbut it does mean watching the system closely and
tuning so that no single part is consistently waiting on another.</p>
<p>This seems obvious, but getting the balance right is harder than you might
think, even in a simple setup. The art is in finding that equilibrium where
throughput is steady, compute is well used, and progress is smooth instead of lumpy.</p>
<h3 id="just-do-the-dumb-thing-until-it-breaks">Just Do the Dumb Thing Until It Breaks<a class="headerlink" href="#just-do-the-dumb-thing-until-it-breaks" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Writing checkpoints to disk ended up being much more effective than sending
weights directly over the network from trainer to generator. This was both
faster and more memory-efficient than trying fancy inter-process techniques. If
I had more time, I'd figure out how to improve direct-over-network transfer, but
that would double Wi-Fi uplink bandwidth, since the trainer would need to
broadcast weights to both generators. Writing to my NAS means the weights only
cross the Wi-Fi link once per update.</p>
<p>There is virtue in living with certain dumb things.</p>
<h3 id="most-time-is-spent-on-environment-setup">Most Time Is Spent on Environment Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#most-time-is-spent-on-environment-setup" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>This confirmed what I already knew from big labs: you'll spend most of your time
tweaking and tuning the runtime, and less on the algorithm.</p>
<p>The bright side is I still managed to spend a higher percentage of my time
on algorithms and tradeoffs. Even so, learning the intricacies of Ray, CUDA, uv,
and so on took most of my time.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-is-hard-maintainers-and-authors">Open Source Is Hard, ‚ù§Ô∏è Maintainers and Authors<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-is-hard-maintainers-and-authors" title="Link to this section">¬∂</a></h3>
<p>Maybe the most significant learning of all: I realized just how difficult it is
to maintain a large OSS project like Ray. Even with significant community and
corporate support, the level of commitment required from maintainers is something
I now appreciate much more.</p>
<p>In the past, when I ran into a shortcoming in a software package, I often felt
frustrated that the author hadn't considered my use case. I'd look for
alternatives, or in rare cases make the mistake of trying to build my own.</p>
<p>Ray is an incredible project with amazing maintainers. In the rare cases I did
find issues, I didn't feel frustrated. Maybe this is what becoming an adult with
a mortgage and a child feels like, or maybe it's the effect of taking
five weeks off to write and reflect. In any case, all the packages I used ‚Äî from
Ray and PyTorch to <code>markdown</code> to Python itself ‚Äî are the work of an incredible open-source
ecosystem with insanely talented contributors. Thank you all.</p>
